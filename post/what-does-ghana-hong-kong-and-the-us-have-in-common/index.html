We were ready to leave when we met a group of shop owners near the entrance who were more curious about figuring out where exactly I was from.</p><p>&ldquo;I was born in California,&rdquo; I added, if that made my Americanness any more persuasive. To them, it didn’t matter where I was born. It was how I looked.</p><p>In my three weeks here, I&rsquo;ve lost track of the &ldquo;ni hao&rdquo; greetings I&rsquo;ve received on the streets. Sometimes it’s from kids not even 8 years old. On other occasions, I’m sitting in the backseat of an Uber in the middle of an intersection when a trotro (bus) driver looks at me and shouts, “Hey ching chong!”&ndash;twice. In any case, I usually respond with a polite hello and a smile, and walk away. Sometimes my American accent catches them off guard. Mandarin isn&rsquo;t even my mother tongue. In Cantonese&ndash;my first language&ndash;we say “hello,” a product of British rule of Hong Kong for over 150 years, or sometimes “nei5 hou2.”</p><p>No matter where I go, I always feel slightly out of place. In the US, I&rsquo;m Asian. In Hong Kong, I’m American. At MIT, I’m from the Bay Area. Within my family, I’m Cantonese. Here in Ghana, I come from China. But because I’m always juggling multiple identities, expressed or assumed, I treat it as an opportunity to fluidly adapt to new cultures and environments I find myself in. So far, here in Ghana, I’m not only learning more about the diverse local traditions, identities, and histories that make this country unique&ndash;for example, the numerous local tribes, languages, and cultures, and the legacy of its colonial past&ndash;but about myself, and what it means to be Hong Kong-American in a completely different continent.</p><p>As it turns out, there are a lot more commonalities with Ghana and my own identities than I ever expected.</p><p>To start, let’s talk about food. Food is my favorite way to explore my own culture and new ones wherever I go, and Ghana is no exception. Since I arrived, my co-workers have been introducing me to new local street vendors. I’m trying new dishes every day: waakye, redred, jollof, palava, banku with tilapia, fried plantain, yams, and sweet potatoes, fufu with goat, fried rice, Indomie noodles, pawpaw smoothies, and much more. Banku reminds me of sourdough bread bowls unique to San Francisco. Fufu reminds me of mochi, my favorite dessert. Their take on fried rice and noodles seems to be inspired by similar dishes in Cantonese cuisine. Indomie noodles with sausage remind me of instant ramen with spam I loved as a kid. There’s even this hot pepper sauce called shito that reminds me of fish or shrimp paste used in other Asian dishes. The local Malta drink reminds me of the taste of traditional Chinese herbal jelly. Alvaro brings memories of Martinelli’s from California. Even the culture of street food is reminiscent of a similar culture in Hong Kong. In general, I’ve been surprised at the connections I can make with local dishes here with ones that I’ve grown up with that have become a part of my own identity. These new ingredients have not only excited my taste buds, but expanded my palette to encompass some of the diverse culinary traditions of Ghana and West Africa.</p><div class="tc center pv5-ns pv4 w-100"><img src=https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/2019/ghana/Picture4.png alt="Trying out fufu for the first time at a local food stand near the office.

Both Hong Kong and Ghana (and the US) were former British colonies. I was born two days after the handover of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. Here in Ghana, July 1st is Republic Day, the day Kwame Nkrumah became the country’s first president. Of course, we also celebrate the 4th of July back in the U.S. for our own independence. The most tangible impact of British colonial rule is that, even though these countries span three different continents, English is an official language in all three countries. But in Ghana and Hong Kong, the local languages blend in with British English. Here I’ve started to switch out “that’s right” or “you see?” with “aha,” as well as using “please” more often. I already say “ah” and “aiya” way too many times, and put “lah” at the end of my sentences, as Hongkongers like to do. We even use “aunty” in both countries to refer to a woman older and to show respect or deference. In Ghana, there’s Pidgin English; in Hong Kong, or whenever I converse with my parents, we often mix the two together and call it Chinglish or Kongish. “Okay, please,” perhaps I’ll carry with me some of the “small small” slang I’ve picked up here, “aha.”</p><div class="tc center pv5-ns pv4 w-100"><img src=https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/2019/ghana/Picture3.png alt class="tc w-100"></div><div class="tc center pv5-ns pv4 w-100"><img src=https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/2019/ghana/Picture2.png alt="A glimpse of the neighborhood I’m living in this summer.

I’m no longer afraid of people asking me where I’m from. It’s only a superficial question. Where we’re from shouldn’t be the only thing that distinguishes us from one another; instead it should be an opportunity to engage in dialogue and uncover shared experiences that bring us closer together. Just in my short time here, I’ve found that we have more things in common than we might think.</p><div class="tc center pv5-ns pv4 w-100"><img src=https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/2019/ghana/Picture1.png alt="Relaxing next to the beach in Accra, Ghana, on my day off.
