    <p>After sleeping in, I convinced myself to go on a hiking adventure. I considered committing to an all-day trip to Rainier or a closer drive around Snoqualmie. The weather was decent so I thought I&rsquo;d make a bet on heading into the mountains before winter (and the snow) hits. After some research online, I chose the <a href="https://visitrainier.com/skyline-trail-panorama-point/">Skyline Trail</a> for the picturesque views. I refueled my car at Costco, picked up some cash and a lunch, and was on my way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never done a road trip on my own, but I turned up a playlist and starting singing like I was in the shower. Two and a half hours later, I was driving through the foothills of Rainier, driving under the canopies of the evergreens.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/web/20191013/DSC00331.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>At the gate, I picked up an <a href="https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm">America the Beautiful</a> pass valid at all US National Parks for a year.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/web/20191013/DSC00396.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I parked in Paradise, and checked into the visitor center. It was around 3:30pm already. One of the rangers warned that the trails were icy and that I&rsquo;d better do a lower elevation hike given that I didn&rsquo;t bring along poles or technical equiptment. I thought I&rsquo;d give it a shot and turn back once I saw ice.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/web/20191013/DSC00333.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There were more people than I expected, but the people quickly dispersed as I entered into the thick fog. I hoped the weather would clear up as I continued heading deeper into the trail. The air smelled sweet and musky, but the winds got stronger and brisker as I approached higher elevations. It was peaceful and quiet, excatly what I wanted out of this hike.</p>

<p>The fog did not quite disperse, but there were some transiet pockets of sunshine and blue skies along the way. I was glad to have brough gloves.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/web/20191013/DSC00339.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Soon enough, I spotted ice on the outskirts of the paths, but the trails were dry enough to continue on with just my running shoes.</p>

<p>The terrain changed from mountainous and foresty to rocky and bushy. With the thick fog, the landscape seemed to come from a movie set or extraterrestrial planets. Even though I couldn&rsquo;t see much beyond a few meters in front of me, it still felt like an adventure, kind of like slowly scratching away the strip on a card to reveal more numbers or secrets. It was quite empty near the top, only encountering hikers here and there. The mood was almost eerie but captivating.</p>

<p>At Panorama Point, there wasn&rsquo;t much of a view, so I rested briefly for a snack and continued my journey onwards. I wanted to get back down before sunset so I continued at a fast pace back down the hill. The hike was estimated at around 4 hours, but I completed it in 2.5. My legs were sore for a few days after though.</p>

<p>Before I departed back to Seattle, I made a stop at Reflection Lakes, but there still wasn&rsquo;t a view of Rainier, hidden in the thicks of the fog. But, along the way, there was a stunning view of the valley and some hints of the sun setting behind some of the hills.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinshum.blob.core.windows.net/web/20191013/DSC00397.jpg" alt="" />

<p>I&rsquo;ll definitely make a trip back in the spring, hopefully with views of the peak next time. Fog or not, this was a solo hike to remember.</p>
